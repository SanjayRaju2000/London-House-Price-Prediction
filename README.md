## London House Price Prediction
=========================

### Executive Summary
This project aims to develop statistical machine learning models to predict London house prices based on housing property features. 

### Current Progress
Initial models using linear and Ridge regression provided a baseline understanding but showed limitations with anomalous coefficients and modest accuracy.

### Demo

... Show your work:
...     Data visualisations
...     Interactive demo (e.g., stremlit app)
